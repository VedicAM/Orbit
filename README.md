# Orbit
This is a celestial body orbit simulator which at the moment can handle only two celestial bodies. The green celestial body will always have a bigger mass than the blue celestial body. Do keep in mind that these celestial bodies are not draw to scale!

## Running
This program is made in Python so please make sure you have the latest version of Python downloaded first. This program also uses two main dependencies, NumPy(for the calculations) and Pygame(for the rendering). To install NumPy and Pygame please run this command:
``python3 -m pip install numpy pygame``. Once done to run the program please run this command: ``python3 main.py``.

## Controls
Once you run the program you are prompted with two questions regarding your initial velocity, this is where you can enter the initial velocity of your blue celestial body. You can left-click anywhere on the screen to place your own blue celestial body. You can use the + and - keys to change the mass of your celestial body. You can right-click anywhere on the screen to move the green celestial body. You can also move the arrow keys to move the green celestial body for more finer control.

## Demo
Here is a video that demonstrates the program:
